[Zeabur](https://zeabur.com) offers hosting for full-stack web applications. Astro sites can be hosted as both SSR or static output.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Zeabur through the website UI.

## Project Configuration

### Static Site

Astro outputs a static site by default. There is no need for any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Zeabur. 

### Server-Rendered Site

With the `@astrojs/node` adapter installed, Zeabur can deploy your server-side rendered Astro project.

1. If not already installed, [add the `@astrojs/node` adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/#installation) to your project.

2. Modify the start command in your `package.json` file:

    ```json title="package.json" {3}
    {
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node dist/server/entry.mjs"
      }
    }
    ```

## How to deploy

You can deploy your Astro site to Zeabur if the project is stored in GitHub.

1. Click <kbd>Create new project</kbd> in the [Zeabur dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com).

2. Configure GitHub installation and import the repository.

3. Zeabur will automatically detect that your project is an Astro project and will build it using the `astro build` command.

4. Once the build is complete, you can bind a domain to your site and visit it.

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate new builds.
